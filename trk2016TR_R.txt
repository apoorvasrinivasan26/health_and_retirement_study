         Hispanic populations in order to boost the size of the minority samples in those
         cohorts.  This supplemental sample is referred to as the minority oversample. 
         The variable "MOSFLAG" flags respondents who are in this subsample (1=in
         minority oversample).

OVHHID                   OVERLAP CASE: OLD HHID
         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Character  Width: 6   Decimals: 0

         There are two types of overlap cases in the HRS and AHEAD. First, there were a
         number of original HRS Wave 1 households eligible to be either an HRS or AHEAD
         household. An interview was attempted for each in HRS Wave 1. Afterwards, a
         random subsampling was performed, with 60% of the cases staying in HRS and the
         remaining going to AHEAD. We refer to the 134 cases given over to AHEAD as
         HRS/AHEAD overlap. Among those 134 cases assigned to AHEAD, however, only 110
         were actually interviewed.
         
         Second, there are four cases of inter-respondent overlap resulting from
         inter-marriage among respondents who entered the study in separate households.
         These occurred in 1998, 2010, and 2012. In each case, one respondent in the
         newly paired couple assumed the household identifier of his or her new spouse,
         but retained the previous identifier in the OVHHID and OVPN fields.
         
         For more information, please see variables OVPN, and OVRESULT, and the Overlap
         section of the Data Description.

         This variable is either the old HRS PN for the HRS/AHEAD overlap cases that gave
         an AHEAD interview, or the original PN for the cases of inter-respondent
         marriage.

         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 1   Decimals: 0

         This is the stratum half-sample code for analysis of sampling error using the
         BRR method or approximate 'two-per-stratum' Taylor Series method (Kish and Hess,
         1959). Within the SR sampling error strata, the half sample units are created by
         dividing sample cases into random halves, HALF SAMPLE CODE = 1 and HALF SAMPLE
         CODE = 2.

         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 2   Decimals: 0

         This code is the variable which defines the sampling error computation strata of
         the HRS data. With the exception of New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago MSAs,
         each self-representing (SR) design stratum is represented by one sampling error
         computation stratum.  Due to their population size, two sampling error
         computation strata are defined for each of the three largest MSAs.  Pairs of
         similar nonself-representing (NSR) primary stage design strata are 'collapsed'
         (Kalton, 1977) to create NSR sampling error computation strata.
         
         Please note that HRS 2016 undertook a new sample design in order to reflect the
         dynamics in changing population compositions. This resulted in a change to the
         weights, which is described in Section 5 of the data description, and also
         resulted in an expansion of the STRATUM values. Until HRS 2014, STRATUM values
         ranged from 1 to 56; starting in 2016, the value ranges from 1 to 80.

WTCOHORT                 BIRTH COHORT AT ENTRY
         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 3   Decimals: 0

         Prior to 2004, this variable was used for creating household-level and
         respondent-level weight variables for each wave. (From 2004 onward, birth year
         is used.) WTCOHORT is constructed using a 'first-mention' or 'entry-wave' birth
         year measure. Respondents with no available birth year at the time of entry into
         the study were assigned the weight cohort of their spouse/partner. This may
         differ from the BIRTHYR variable in this file because BIRTHYR is updated on the
         basis of new information obtained in subsequent waves.

         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 3   Decimals: 0

         xAGE is constructed using a 'best source' method, if there was more than one
         birthdate given in different waves. We used a self report as most reliable,
         followed by a spouse report, and finally a non spouse proxy. The tracker file
         and the public data use the last date of birth given, regardless of the source.
         This results in some discrepancies between xAGE and BIRTHYR.

         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 1   Decimals: 0

         This variable is based on HRS tracking efforts when there is no core or exit
         interview in the current wave, or an exit interview was not obtained in a prior
         wave. When vital status is not certain, respondents are coded as alive or
         deceased in the current wave (1 or 5) based on reports from someone capable of
         reporting a death. If no contact was made in the current wave, respondents are
         coded as presumed alive (2). Respondents coded as 5 in the previous wave are
         coded in this wave as "6 Known deceased as of prior wave." By definition, no
         respondents can be deceased at the baseline interview, or they would have been
         excluded from the sample. The baseline for HRS is HRS 1992; for AHEAD is AHEAD
         1993; for CODA and WB is HRS 1998; for EBB is HRS 2004; and for MBB is HRS 2010.

         a concatenation of the person numbers of the members of the household in
         ascending order.

         In the baseline interview, all households for the wave are considered 'original'
         households, and so all have a SUBHH of zero. Respondents can have a
         sub-household identifier at a particular wave even if they did not provide an

         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 4   Decimals: 0

         This weight should be used in making inferences to HOUSEHOLDS in the US in 1992
         containing at least one individual born in the 1931-1941 birth cohorts. It is
         based on the original sampling rate for cohort eligible financial units. It has
         been post-stratified to the March 1992 Current Population Survey based on the
         birth-cohort of each unmarried individual and the birth cohorts of each spouse
         in married couples, their race/ethnicity, and their marital status. The HRS
         definition of a household (a financial unit consisting of uncoupled individuals,
         married couples, or unmarried couples that operate as a financial unit) differs
         from CPS definitions and CPS data are restructured for post-stratification. See
         http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu/index.php?p=userg for more information about
         weight construction.

         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 3   Decimals: 0

         xAGE is constructed using a 'best source' method, if there was more than one
         birthdate given in different waves. We used a self report as most reliable,
         followed by a spouse report, and finally a non spouse proxy. The tracker file
         and the public data use the last date of birth given, regardless of the source.
         This results in some discrepancies between xAGE and BIRTHYR.

         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 1   Decimals: 0

         This variable is based on HRS tracking efforts when there is no core or exit
         interview in the current wave, or an exit interview was not obtained in a prior
         wave. When vital status is not certain, respondents are coded as alive or
         deceased in the current wave (1 or 5) based on reports from someone capable of
         reporting a death. If no contact was made in the current wave, respondents are
         coded as presumed alive (2). Respondents coded as 5 in the previous wave are
         coded in this wave as "6 Known deceased as of prior wave." By definition, no
         respondents can be deceased at the baseline interview, or they would have been
         excluded from the sample. The baseline for HRS is HRS 1992; for AHEAD is AHEAD
         1993; for CODA and WB is HRS 1998; for EBB is HRS 2004; and for MBB is HRS 2010.

         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Character  Width: 1   Decimals: 0

         In the baseline interview, all households for the wave are considered 'original'
         households, and so all have a SUBHH of zero. Respondents can have a
         sub-household identifier at a particular wave even if they did not provide an
         interview.

BWGTHH                   1993 WEIGHT: HOUSEHOLD-LEVEL
         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 5   Decimals: 0

         This weight should be used in making inferences to HOUSEHOLDS in the US in 1993
         containing at least one individual born in the 1890-1923 birth cohorts. It is
         based on the original sampling rate for cohort eligible financial units. It has
         been post-stratified to the March 1993 Current Population Survey based on the
         birth-cohort of each unmarried individual and the birth cohorts of each spouse
         in married couples, their race/ethnicity, and their marital status. The HRS
         definition of a household (a financial unit consisting of uncoupled individuals,
         married couples, or unmarried couples that operate as a financial unit) differs
         from CPS definitions and CPS data are restructured for post-stratification. See
         http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu/index.php?p=userg for more information about
         weight construction.

         to the March 1993 Current Population Survey based on the birth-cohort of each

         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 3   Decimals: 0

         xAGE is constructed using a 'best source' method, if there was more than one
         birthdate given in different waves. We used a self report as most reliable,
         followed by a spouse report, and finally a non spouse proxy. The tracker file
         and the public data use the last date of birth given, regardless of the source.
         This results in some discrepancies between xAGE and BIRTHYR.

         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 1   Decimals: 0

         This variable is based on HRS tracking efforts when there is no core or exit
         interview in the current wave, or an exit interview was not obtained in a prior
         wave. When vital status is not certain, respondents are coded as alive or
         deceased in the current wave (1 or 5) based on reports from someone capable of
         reporting a death. If no contact was made in the current wave, respondents are
         coded as presumed alive (2). Respondents coded as 5 in the previous wave are
         coded in this wave as "6 Known deceased as of prior wave." By definition, no
         respondents can be deceased at the baseline interview, or they would have been
         excluded from the sample. The baseline for HRS is HRS 1992; for AHEAD is AHEAD
         1993; for CODA and WB is HRS 1998; for EBB is HRS 2004; and for MBB is HRS 2010.

         variable if they were in the same household and sub-household in the wave. It is
         a concatenation of the person numbers of the members of the household in
         ascending order.

         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 4   Decimals: 0

         This weight should be used in making inferences to HOUSEHOLDS in the US in 1994
         containing at least one individual born in the 1931-1941 birth cohorts. It is
         based on the original sampling rate for cohort eligible financial units. It has
         been post-stratified to the March 1994 Current Population Survey based on the
         birth-cohort of each unmarried individual and the birth cohorts of each spouse
         in married couples, their race/ethnicity, and their marital status. The HRS
         definition of a household (a financial unit consisting of uncoupled individuals,
         married couples, or unmarried couples that operate as a financial unit) differs
         from CPS definitions and CPS data are restructured for post-stratification. See
         http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu/index.php?p=userg for more information about
         weight construction.

         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 3   Decimals: 0

         xAGE is constructed using a 'best source' method, if there was more than one
         birthdate given in different waves. We used a self report as most reliable,
         followed by a spouse report, and finally a non spouse proxy. The tracker file
         and the public data use the last date of birth given, regardless of the source.
         This results in some discrepancies between xAGE and BIRTHYR.

         This variable is based on HRS tracking efforts when there is no core or exit
         interview in the current wave, or an exit interview was not obtained in a prior
         wave. When vital status is not certain, respondents are coded as alive or
         deceased in the current wave (1 or 5) based on reports from someone capable of
         reporting a death. If no contact was made in the current wave, respondents are
         coded as presumed alive (2). Respondents coded as 5 in the previous wave are
         coded in this wave as "6 Known deceased as of prior wave." By definition, no
         respondents can be deceased at the baseline interview, or they would have been
         excluded from the sample. The baseline for HRS is HRS 1992; for AHEAD is AHEAD
         1993; for CODA and WB is HRS 1998; for EBB is HRS 2004; and for MBB is HRS 2010.

         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 5   Decimals: 0

         This weight should be used in making inferences to HOUSEHOLDS in the US in 1995
         containing at least one individual born in the 1890-1923 birth cohorts. It is
         based on the original sampling rate for cohort eligible financial units. It has
         been post-stratified to the March 1995 Current Population Survey based on the
         birth-cohort of each unmarried individual and the birth cohorts of each spouse
         in married couples, their race/ethnicity, and their marital status. The HRS
         definition of a household (a financial unit consisting of uncoupled individuals,
         married couples, or unmarried couples that operate as a financial unit) differs
         from CPS definitions and CPS data are restructured for post-stratification. See
         http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu/index.php?p=userg for more information about
         weight construction.

         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 3   Decimals: 0

         xAGE is constructed using a 'best source' method, if there was more than one
         birthdate given in different waves. We used a self report as most reliable,
         followed by a spouse report, and finally a non spouse proxy. The tracker file
         and the public data use the last date of birth given, regardless of the source.
         This results in some discrepancies between xAGE and BIRTHYR.

         This variable is based on HRS tracking efforts when there is no core or exit
         interview in the current wave, or an exit interview was not obtained in a prior
         wave. When vital status is not certain, respondents are coded as alive or
         deceased in the current wave (1 or 5) based on reports from someone capable of
         reporting a death. If no contact was made in the current wave, respondents are
         coded as presumed alive (2). Respondents coded as 5 in the previous wave are
         coded in this wave as "6 Known deceased as of prior wave." By definition, no
         respondents can be deceased at the baseline interview, or they would have been
         excluded from the sample. The baseline for HRS is HRS 1992; for AHEAD is AHEAD
         1993; for CODA and WB is HRS 1998; for EBB is HRS 2004; and for MBB is HRS 2010.

         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 4   Decimals: 0

         This weight should be used in making inferences to HOUSEHOLDS in the US in 1996
         containing at least one individual born in the 1931-1941 birth cohorts. It is
         based on the original sampling rate for cohort eligible financial units. It has
         been post-stratified to the March 1996 Current Population Survey based on the
         birth-cohort of each unmarried individual and the birth cohorts of each spouse
         in married couples, their race/ethnicity, and their marital status. The HRS
         definition of a household (a financial unit consisting of uncoupled individuals,
         married couples, or unmarried couples that operate as a financial unit) differs
         from CPS definitions and CPS data are restructured for post-stratification. See
         http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu/index.php?p=userg for more information about
         weight construction.

         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 3   Decimals: 0

         xAGE is constructed using a 'best source' method, if there was more than one
         birthdate given in different waves. We used a self report as most reliable,
         followed by a spouse report, and finally a non spouse proxy. The tracker file
         and the public data use the last date of birth given, regardless of the source.
         This results in some discrepancies between xAGE and BIRTHYR.

         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 1   Decimals: 0

         This variable is based on HRS tracking efforts when there is no core or exit
         interview in the current wave, or an exit interview was not obtained in a prior
         wave. When vital status is not certain, respondents are coded as alive or
         deceased in the current wave (1 or 5) based on reports from someone capable of
         reporting a death. If no contact was made in the current wave, respondents are
         coded as presumed alive (2). Respondents coded as 5 in the previous wave are
         coded in this wave as "6 Known deceased as of prior wave." By definition, no
         respondents can be deceased at the baseline interview, or they would have been
         excluded from the sample. The baseline for HRS is HRS 1992; for AHEAD is AHEAD
         1993; for CODA and WB is HRS 1998; for EBB is HRS 2004; and for MBB is HRS 2010.

         This variable may be used to identify two potential respondents in the same
         household in a particular wave. Respondents will share the same value on the
         variable if they were in the same household and sub-household in the wave. It is
         a concatenation of the person numbers of the members of the household in
         ascending order.

FWGTHH                   1998 WEIGHT: HOUSEHOLD-LEVEL
         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 5   Decimals: 0

         This weight should be used in making inferences to HOUSEHOLDS in the US in 1998
         containing at least one individual born prior to 1948. It is based on the
         original sampling rate for cohort eligible financial units. It has been
         post-stratified to the March 1998 Current Population Survey based on the
         birth-cohort of each unmarried individual and the birth cohorts of each spouse
         in married couples, their race/ethnicity, and their marital status. The HRS
         definition of a household (a financial unit consisting of uncoupled individuals,
         married couples, or unmarried couples that operate as a financial unit) differs
         from CPS definitions and CPS data are restructured for post-stratification. See
         http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu/index.php?p=userg for more information about
         weight construction.

         to the March 1998 Current Population Survey based on the birth-cohort of each

         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 3   Decimals: 0

         xAGE is constructed using a 'best source' method, if there was more than one
         birthdate given in different waves. We used a self report as most reliable,
         followed by a spouse report, and finally a non spouse proxy. The tracker file
         and the public data use the last date of birth given, regardless of the source.
         This results in some discrepancies between xAGE and BIRTHYR.

         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 1   Decimals: 0

         This variable is based on HRS tracking efforts when there is no core or exit
         interview in the current wave, or an exit interview was not obtained in a prior
         wave. When vital status is not certain, respondents are coded as alive or
         deceased in the current wave (1 or 5) based on reports from someone capable of
         reporting a death. If no contact was made in the current wave, respondents are
         coded as presumed alive (2). Respondents coded as 5 in the previous wave are
         coded in this wave as "6 Known deceased as of prior wave." By definition, no
         respondents can be deceased at the baseline interview, or they would have been
         excluded from the sample. The baseline for HRS is HRS 1992; for AHEAD is AHEAD
         1993; for CODA and WB is HRS 1998; for EBB is HRS 2004; and for MBB is HRS 2010.

         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 5   Decimals: 0

         This weight should be used in making inferences to HOUSEHOLDS in the US in 2000
         containing at least one individual born prior to 1948. It is based on the
         original sampling rate for cohort eligible financial units. It has been
         post-stratified to the March 2000 Current Population Survey based on the
         birth-cohort of each unmarried individual and the birth cohorts of each spouse
         in married couples, their race/ethnicity, and their marital status. The HRS
         definition of a household (a financial unit consisting of uncoupled individuals,
         married couples, or unmarried couples that operate as a financial unit) differs
         from CPS definitions and CPS data are restructured for post-stratification. See
         http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu/index.php?p=userg for more information about
         weight construction.

         xAGE is constructed using a 'best source' method, if there was more than one
         birthdate given in different waves. We used a self report as most reliable,
         followed by a spouse report, and finally a non spouse proxy. The tracker file
         and the public data use the last date of birth given, regardless of the source.
         This results in some discrepancies between xAGE and BIRTHYR.

         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 1   Decimals: 0

         This variable is based on HRS tracking efforts when there is no core or exit
         interview in the current wave, or an exit interview was not obtained in a prior
         wave. When vital status is not certain, respondents are coded as alive or
         deceased in the current wave (1 or 5) based on reports from someone capable of
         reporting a death. If no contact was made in the current wave, respondents are
         coded as presumed alive (2). Respondents coded as 5 in the previous wave are
         coded in this wave as "6 Known deceased as of prior wave." By definition, no
         respondents can be deceased at the baseline interview, or they would have been
         excluded from the sample. The baseline for HRS is HRS 1992; for AHEAD is AHEAD
         1993; for CODA and WB is HRS 1998; for EBB is HRS 2004; and for MBB is HRS 2010.

         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 5   Decimals: 0

         This weight should be used in making inferences to HOUSEHOLDS in the US in 2002
         containing at least one individual born prior to 1948. It is based on the
         original sampling rate for cohort eligible financial units. It has been
         post-stratified to the March 2002 Current Population Survey based on the
         birth-cohort of each unmarried individual and the birth cohorts of each spouse
         in married couples, their race/ethnicity, and their marital status. The HRS
         definition of a household (a financial unit consisting of uncoupled individuals,
         married couples, or unmarried couples that operate as a financial unit) differs
         from CPS definitions and CPS data are restructured for post-stratification. See
         http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu/index.php?p=userg for more information about
         weight construction.

         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 3   Decimals: 0

         xAGE is constructed using a 'best source' method, if there was more than one
         birthdate given in different waves. We used a self report as most reliable,
         followed by a spouse report, and finally a non spouse proxy. The tracker file
         and the public data use the last date of birth given, regardless of the source.
         This results in some discrepancies between xAGE and BIRTHYR.

         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 1   Decimals: 0

         This variable is based on HRS tracking efforts when there is no core or exit
         interview in the current wave, or an exit interview was not obtained in a prior
         wave. When vital status is not certain, respondents are coded as alive or
         deceased in the current wave (1 or 5) based on reports from someone capable of
         reporting a death. If no contact was made in the current wave, respondents are
         coded as presumed alive (2). Respondents coded as 5 in the previous wave are
         coded in this wave as "6 Known deceased as of prior wave." By definition, no
         respondents can be deceased at the baseline interview, or they would have been
         excluded from the sample. The baseline for HRS is HRS 1992; for AHEAD is AHEAD
         1993; for CODA and WB is HRS 1998; for EBB is HRS 2004; and for MBB is HRS 2010.

         This variable may be used to identify two potential respondents in the same
         household in a particular wave. Respondents will share the same value on the
         variable if they were in the same household and sub-household in the wave. It is
         a concatenation of the person numbers of the members of the household in
         ascending order.

         In the baseline interview, all households for the wave are considered 'original'
         households, and so all have a SUBHH of zero. Respondents can have a
         sub-household identifier at a particular wave even if they did not provide an

         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 7   Decimals: 0

         This weight should be used in making inferences to HOUSEHOLDS in the US in 2004
         containing at least one individual born prior to 1954. It is based on the
         original sampling rate for cohort eligible financial units. It has been
         post-stratified to the 2004 American Community Survey (ACS) based on the
         birth-cohort of each unmarried individual and the birth cohorts of each spouse
         in married couples, their race/ethnicity, and their marital status. The HRS
         definition of a household (a financial unit consisting of uncoupled individuals,
         married couples, or unmarried couples that operate as a financial unit) differs
         from ACS definitions and ACS data are restructured for post-stratification. See
         http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu/index.php?p=userg for more information about
         weight construction.

         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 3   Decimals: 0

         xAGE is constructed using a 'best source' method, if there was more than one
         birthdate given in different waves. We used a self report as most reliable,
         followed by a spouse report, and finally a non spouse proxy. The tracker file
         and the public data use the last date of birth given, regardless of the source.
         This results in some discrepancies between xAGE and BIRTHYR.

         This variable is based on HRS tracking efforts when there is no core or exit
         interview in the current wave, or an exit interview was not obtained in a prior
         wave. When vital status is not certain, respondents are coded as alive or
         deceased in the current wave (1 or 5) based on reports from someone capable of
         reporting a death. If no contact was made in the current wave, respondents are
         coded as presumed alive (2). Respondents coded as 5 in the previous wave are
         coded in this wave as "6 Known deceased as of prior wave." By definition, no
         respondents can be deceased at the baseline interview, or they would have been
         excluded from the sample. The baseline for HRS is HRS 1992; for AHEAD is AHEAD
         1993; for CODA and WB is HRS 1998; for EBB is HRS 2004; and for MBB is HRS 2010.

         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 7   Decimals: 0

         This weight should be used in making inferences to HOUSEHOLDS in the US in 2006
         containing at least one individual born prior to 1954. It is based on the
         original sampling rate for cohort eligible financial units. It has been
         post-stratified to the 2006 American Community Survey (ACS) based on the
         birth-cohort of each unmarried individual and the birth cohorts of each spouse
         in married couples, their race/ethnicity, and their marital status. The HRS
         definition of a household (a financial unit consisting of uncoupled individuals,
         married couples, or unmarried couples that operate as a financial unit) differs
         from ACS definitions and ACS data are restructured for post-stratification. See
         http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu/index.php?p=userg for more information about
         weight construction.

         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 3   Decimals: 0

         xAGE is constructed using a 'best source' method, if there was more than one
         birthdate given in different waves. We used a self report as most reliable,
         followed by a spouse report, and finally a non spouse proxy. The tracker file
         and the public data use the last date of birth given, regardless of the source.
         This results in some discrepancies between xAGE and BIRTHYR.

         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 1   Decimals: 0

         This variable is based on HRS tracking efforts when there is no core or exit
         interview in the current wave, or an exit interview was not obtained in a prior
         wave. When vital status is not certain, respondents are coded as alive or
         deceased in the current wave (1 or 5) based on reports from someone capable of
         reporting a death. If no contact was made in the current wave, respondents are
         coded as presumed alive (2). Respondents coded as 5 in the previous wave are
         coded in this wave as "6 Known deceased as of prior wave." By definition, no
         respondents can be deceased at the baseline interview, or they would have been
         excluded from the sample. The baseline for HRS is HRS 1992; for AHEAD is AHEAD
         1993; for CODA and WB is HRS 1998; for EBB is HRS 2004; and for MBB is HRS 2010.

         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 7   Decimals: 0

         This weight should be used in making inferences to HOUSEHOLDS in the US in 2008
         containing at least one individual born prior to 1954. It is based on the
         original sampling rate for cohort eligible financial units. It has been
         post-stratified to the 2008 American Community Survey (ACS) based on the
         birth-cohort of each unmarried individual and the birth cohorts of each spouse
         in married couples, their race/ethnicity, and their marital status. The HRS
         definition of a household (a financial unit consisting of uncoupled individuals,
         married couples, or unmarried couples that operate as a financial unit) differs
         from ACS definitions and ACS data are restructured for post-stratification. See

MAGE                     AGE AT 2010 INTERVIEW
         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 3   Decimals: 0

         xAGE is constructed using a 'best source' method, if there was more than one
         birthdate given in different waves. We used a self report as most reliable,
         followed by a spouse report, and finally a non spouse proxy. The tracker file

         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 1   Decimals: 0

         This variable is based on HRS tracking efforts when there is no core or exit
         interview in the current wave, or an exit interview was not obtained in a prior
         wave. When vital status is not certain, respondents are coded as alive or
         deceased in the current wave (1 or 5) based on reports from someone capable of
         reporting a death. If no contact was made in the current wave, respondents are
         coded as presumed alive (2). Respondents coded as 5 in the previous wave are
         coded in this wave as "6 Known deceased as of prior wave." By definition, no
         respondents can be deceased at the baseline interview, or they would have been
         excluded from the sample. The baseline for HRS is HRS 1992; for AHEAD is AHEAD
         1993; for CODA and WB is HRS 1998; for EBB is HRS 2004; and for MBB is HRS 2010.

         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 7   Decimals: 0

         This weight should be used in making inferences to HOUSEHOLDS in the US in 2010
         containing at least one individual born prior to 1959. It is based on the
         original sampling rate for cohort eligible financial units. It has been 
         post-stratified to the 2010 American Community Survey (ACS) based on the
         birth-cohort of each unmarried individual and the birth cohorts of each spouse
         in married couples, their race/ethnicity, and their marital status. The HRS
         definition of a household (a financial unit consisting of uncoupled individual,
         married couples, or unmarried couples that operate as a financial unit) differs
         from ACS definitions and ACS data are restructured for post-stratification. See

         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 3   Decimals: 0

         xAGE is constructed using a 'best source' method, if there was more than one
         birthdate given in different waves. We used a self report as most reliable,
         followed by a spouse report, and finally a non spouse proxy. The tracker file
         and the public data use the last date of birth given, regardless of the source.
         This results in some discrepancies between xAGE and BIRTHYR.

         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 1   Decimals: 0

         This variable is based on HRS tracking efforts when there is no core or exit
         interview in the current wave, or an exit interview was not obtained in a prior
         wave. When vital status is not certain, respondents are coded as alive or
         deceased in the current wave (1 or 5) based on reports from someone capable of
         reporting a death. If no contact was made in the current wave, respondents are
         coded as presumed alive (2). Respondents coded as 5 in the previous wave are
         coded in this wave as "6 Known deceased as of prior wave." By definition, no
         respondents can be deceased at the baseline interview, or they would have been
         excluded from the sample. The baseline for HRS is HRS 1992; for AHEAD is AHEAD
         1993; for CODA and WB is HRS 1998; for EBB is HRS 2004; and for MBB is HRS 2010.

         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 7   Decimals: 0

         This weight should be used in making inferences to HOUSEHOLDS in the US in 2012
         containing at least one individual born prior to 1959. It is based on the
         original sampling rate for cohort eligible financial units. It has been 
         post-stratified to the 2012 American Community Survey (ACS) based on the
         birth-cohort of each unmarried individual and the birth cohorts of each spouse
         in married couples, their race/ethnicity, and their marital status. The HRS
         definition of a household (a financial unit consisting of uncoupled individual,
         married couples, or unmarried couples that operate as a financial unit) differs
         from ACS definitions and ACS data are restructured for post-stratification. See
         http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu/index.php?p=userg for more information about
         weight construction.

         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 3   Decimals: 0

         xAGE is constructed using a 'best source' method, if there was more than one
         birthdate given in different waves. We used a self report as most reliable,
         followed by a spouse report, and finally a non spouse proxy. The tracker file
         and the public data use the last date of birth given, regardless of the source.
         This results in some discrepancies between xAGE and BIRTHYR.

         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 1   Decimals: 0

         This variable is based on HRS tracking efforts when there is no core or exit
         interview in the current wave, or an exit interview was not obtained in a prior
         wave. When vital status is not certain, respondents are coded as alive or
         deceased in the current wave (1 or 5) based on reports from someone capable of
         reporting a death. If no contact was made in the current wave, respondents are
         coded as presumed alive (2). Respondents coded as 5 in the previous wave are
         coded in this wave as "6 Known deceased as of prior wave." By definition, no
         respondents can be deceased at the baseline interview, or they would have been
         excluded from the sample. The baseline for HRS is HRS 1992; for AHEAD is AHEAD
         1993; for CODA and WB is HRS 1998; for EBB is HRS 2004; and for MBB is HRS 2010.

         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 5   Decimals: 0

         This weight should be used in making inferences to HOUSEHOLDS in the US in 2014
         containing at least one individual born prior to 1959. It is based on the
         original sampling rate for cohort eligible financial units. It has been 
         post-stratified to the 2014 American Community Survey (ACS) based on the
         birth-cohort of each unmarried individual and the birth cohorts of each spouse
         in married couples, their race/ethnicity, and their marital status. The HRS
         definition of a household (a financial unit consisting of uncoupled individual,
         married couples, or unmarried couples that operate as a financial unit) differs
         from ACS definitions and ACS data are restructured for post-stratification. See

         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 3   Decimals: 0

         xAGE is constructed using a 'best source' method, if there was more than one
         birthdate given in different waves. We used a self report as most reliable,
         followed by a spouse report, and finally a non spouse proxy. The tracker file
         and the public data use the last date of birth given, regardless of the source.
         This results in some discrepancies between xAGE and BIRTHYR.

         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 1   Decimals: 0

         This variable is based on HRS tracking efforts when there is no core or exit
         interview in the current wave, or an exit interview was not obtained in a prior
         wave. When vital status is not certain, respondents are coded as alive or
         deceased in the current wave (1 or 5) based on reports from someone capable of
         reporting a death. If no contact was made in the current wave, respondents are
         coded as presumed alive (2). Respondents coded as 5 in the previous wave are
         coded in this wave as "6 Known deceased as of prior wave." By definition, no
         respondents can be deceased at the baseline interview, or they would have been
         excluded from the sample. The baselines for HRS cohorts are: HRS 1992; AHEAD
         1993; CODA and WB 1998; EBB 2004; MBB 2010; and LBB 2016.

         This variable may be used to identify two potential respondents in the same
         household in a particular wave. Respondents will share the same value on the
         variable if they were in the same household and sub-household in the wave. It is
         a concatenation of the person numbers of the members of the household in
         ascending order.

PWGTHHE                  2016 WEIGHT: HOUSEHOLD LEVEL
         Section: TR    Level: Respondent      Type: Numeric    Width: 5   Decimals: 0

         Please note that HRS undertook a new sample design in 2016 in order to reflect
         the dynamics in changing population compositions, and made updates to the
         external data source for weighting. This resulted in a change to the weights,
         which is described in Section 5 of the data description.
         
         This weight should be used in making inferences to HOUSEHOLDS in the US in 2016
         containing at least one individual born prior to 1959. It is based on the
         original sampling rate for cohort eligible financial units. It has been 
         post-stratified to the 2016 American Community Survey (ACS) based on the
         birth-cohort of each unmarried individual and the birth cohorts of each spouse
         in married couples, their race/ethnicity, and their marital status. The HRS
         definition of a household (a financial unit consisting of uncoupled individual,
         married couples, or unmarried couples that operate as a financial unit) differs
         from ACS definitions and ACS data are restructured for post-stratification.

         about weight construction.
